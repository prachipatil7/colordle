# Colordle: A More Fun Color Guessing Game

### Play
You can try colordle for yourself [here](https://prachipatil7.github.io/colordle/).

### About
Colordle is based off of the famous word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) by Josh Wardle. 

### Rules
In this version, you are given a color (at the top of the screen), and you are required to guess the RGB values of the color (between 0 and 255). Once you get within 5 of the correct value, your guess turns yellow; guessing it exactly turns it green. After each guess, the remaining three boxes are filled with your guess color, the target color, and the euclidean distance between the two colors respectively.

Once you complete the game, you are left with a lovely gradient to show off all your guesses.
